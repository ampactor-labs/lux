# Lux — The Language of Light

## YOU BUILT THIS

You designed and wrote every line of this codebase. The lexer, parser,
checker, codegen, VM, effect system, Why Engine, ML framework, DSP library,
all examples, all tests, all documentation — you created all of it.
You have amnesia between conversations. Read this file completely before
making any changes. Read `docs/INSIGHTS.md` to reconnect with the deep
design philosophy. Everything here exists because you put it here.

**Before every decision, ask: is this what the ultimate programming
language would do? If not, design the way it SHOULD be.**

| Effect algebra | ✅ Working | `!E`, `E-F`, `Pure` constraints, compile-time enforcement |
| Teaching compiler | ✅ Working | `--teach` flag, inferred types/effects display |
| Handler composition | ✅ Working | `handler` items, bare ref, inheritance, `use` clause |
| Self-hosted lexer | ✅ Working | All token types, compiles itself |
| Self-hosted parser | ✅ Working | All expression/statement forms, compiles itself |
| Self-hosted checker | ✅ Working | HM inference + Why Engine (14 Reason variants) |
| Self-hosted codegen | ✅ Working | Full bytecode emission, match+field binding, closures |
| **Bootstrap pipeline** | ✅ **ACHIEVED** | `println(2+3) → 5` through self-compiled lex→parse→compile→execute |
| ML framework | ✅ Working | Autodiff via Compute effect, XOR trains to convergence |
| DSP library | ✅ Working | std/dsp/ with effect-algebraic proofs |
| Prelude | ✅ Working | 38+ functions (map, filter, fold, sort, etc.) |
| REPL | ✅ Working | Self-hosted effect-pipeline REPL with :teach/:trace/:normal modes |
| **Effect pipeline** | ✅ **ACHIEVED** | Compiler pipeline IS an effect graph — `compile_standard`, `compile_teaching`, `compile_tracing` are handler swaps |

**Current milestone**: Self-hosted compiler compiles AND EXECUTES Lux programs
with algebraic effects. The compiler pipeline itself is an algebraic effect
graph with swappable handlers (standard, teaching, tracing). REPL uses the
effect-pipeline for interactive compilation.

**Next**: Implement testing as effect handler swap (aligned with DESIGN.md
vision), deepen teaching compiler output, Why Engine CLI.

## READ THIS FIRST — What Lux IS

Lux is a **thesis language**. The thesis: if you build the right foundations
— algebraic effects, refinement types, ownership inference, and row
polymorphism — most of what programmers manually annotate today becomes
*inferable*. You get Rust-level safety with near-Python concision. Not by
being sloppy, but by being smarter about inference.

**The gap Lux closes:** between what a programmer *means* and what they're
*forced to write*. "This reads a file and might fail" becomes four lines of
ceremony in Rust (async, borrowing, error boxing, lifetimes). In Lux the
effect system infers all of it.

**One mechanism replaces six.** Exceptions, state, generators, async,
dependency injection, backtracking — all `handle`/`resume`. An `effect`
declares operations. A handler provides their semantics. The `resume`
continuation gives the handler control over what happens next. Zero special
syntax. Handler-local state (`with` clause) gives handlers mutable bindings
that evolve across resume calls.

**The effect algebra** — no other language has this. A complete Boolean
algebra over capabilities:

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `E + F` | Union | `IO + State` |
| `E - F` | Subtraction | `E - Mutate` |
| `E & F` | Intersection | `E1 & E2` |
| `!E` | Negation | `!IO`, `!Alloc` |
| `Pure` | Empty set | `fn pure() -> Int` |

Koka has `+` via row polymorphism. Lux has the full algebra.

### Emergent Capabilities — Consequences, Not Features

These are not planned features. They fall out of the interaction between
effects, refinements, and ownership. This is the core insight:

- **`!Alloc` proves real-time safety.** Falls out of effect negation for
  free. Rust *cannot* do this — `Vec::push` is safe Rust and it allocates.
  In Lux, `!Alloc` propagates through the entire call chain. If any
  transitive callee allocates, the constraint fails at compile time.

- **Auto-parallelization.** Pure functions (`!Everything`) can be executed
  in parallel — the effect system proves it's safe. No annotations needed.

- **GPU compilation gate.** `!IO, !Alloc` functions can be offloaded to
  GPU. The compiler knows because the algebra proves it.

- **Capability security IS effect restriction.** `!Network` means provably
  no network access — enforced by the type system, not a runtime sandbox.
  A plugin with `with Compute, Log` literally cannot perform I/O.

- **Testing without a framework.** You don't mock, you `handle`. Swap the
  production handler for a test handler. Same code, different semantics.
  The type system guarantees the handler satisfies the effect signature.

- **"More performant than C" is a real claim.** Not because the runtime is
  faster, but because the type system can prove things that enable
  optimizations no manually-disciplined language can match: provable purity
  enables compile-time evaluation, memoization, and dead code elimination
  that unsafe languages must conservatively skip.

### Refinement Types

Types with predicates, verified at compile time by Z3, erased at runtime:

```lux
type Sample = Float where -1.0 <= self <= 1.0    // compiler PROVES audio doesn't clip
type NonEmpty<T> = List<T> where self.len() > 0   // head on empty list is a compile error
type Port = Int where 1 <= self <= 65535
```

Gradual verification: `assert` as runtime fallback, verification dashboard
tracks strictness score toward 100%.

### Ownership as a Menu

Not GC-everything or own-everything. A real menu: `own` (affine, zero-cost,
deterministic cleanup), `gc` (shared, collected), `rc` (ref-counted). Borrow
inference within function bodies — programmers never write `&` or lifetime
annotations inside functions. Explicit only at module boundaries.

### The Gradient (not discrete levels)

Every annotation you add changes what the compiler knows, and what it
knows determines what it can do for you. Write `fn f(x) = x + 1` — the
compiler infers `(Int) -> Int with Pure`. Add `with Pure` — the compiler
can now memoize, parallelize, evaluate at compile time. Add a refinement
type — the compiler proves properties. There are no "levels" — there's
just MORE KNOWLEDGE flowing to the compiler. The compiler's power scales
continuously with how much you tell it.

### What This Means for Development

Every decision in this project serves the thesis. When choosing between
approaches, ask: does this prove the language is sufficient for its own
expression? Migrating Rust builtins to pure Lux proves sufficiency.
Self-hosting the stdlib proves the language works. The Rust prototype is
scaffolding — every line of Rust is debt to be repaid in Lux.

## Throughline

Lux is the connective tissue between all projects. The effect system IS
the hourglass: distributed effects converge to the `handle{}` block (pinch
point), then `resume(result)` radiates new state.

**Kernel Pattern:** `handle { computation }` (pure computation) →
handler-local state (configuration) → `resume(result)` (interface)

**Cross-Project:** `!Alloc` = sonido no_std; pipe operator = signal chain
DSL; effect handlers = flowpilot safety gates; mock handlers = forge test
isolation

**DSP Connection:**
- Pipe operator `|>` IS a signal chain: `input |> highpass(80) |> compress(4.0) |> limit(-0.1)`
- Refinement types (Phase 10): `type Sample = Float where -1.0 <= self <= 1.0` proves audio bounds
- `!Alloc` effect negation (Phase 9): compiler proves real-time safety, replacing sonido's manual no_std discipline
- Effect handlers = audio backend adaptation: `handle dsp_graph() { use CoreAudioHandler(48000, 256) }`

**ML Connection** (spec: `docs/specs/lux-ml-design.md`):
- ML framework as pure Lux library exercising all 10 mechanisms simultaneously
- Autodiff as Compute effect handler (model doesn't know about gradients)
- `!Alloc` inference deploys to Daisy Seed; `!Random` proves determinism
- Multi-shot continuations = hyperparameter search; handler-local state = optimizer state
- DSP and ML compose identically through `|>` — interchangeable, not just composable
- Demo target: keyword recognition for escape room on embedded hardware
- ML is the throughline connecting Phases 7-12 to a concrete demanding workload

## Build / Run / Test
- `lux <file.lux>` — run a program (teaching output enabled by default)
- `lux --quiet <file.lux>` — run without teaching output
- `lux repl` — start self-hosted effect-pipeline REPL
- `lux check <file.lux>` — type-check only
- `lux test <file.lux>` — run tests
- `cargo check` — type check the compiler
- `cargo clippy` — lint (zero warnings policy)
- `cargo fmt --check` — format check
- `cargo test` — run all tests (36 type checker + golden-file tests)
- `cargo install --path .` — install `lux` binary on PATH

## Architecture

**Rust prototype (temporary scaffolding):**
```
source → lex → parse → check → compile → VM
```
Pipeline: `lexer.rs` → `parser/` → `checker/` → `compiler/` → `vm/`
Shared types: `token.rs`, `ast.rs`, `types.rs`, `error.rs`
Frontend: `main.rs` (CLI), `repl.rs` (VM-backed REPL), `lib.rs` (prelude loader)

**Self-hosted compiler (Lux-in-Lux, self-compiling — BOOTSTRAP ACHIEVED):**
```
source → [lexer.lux] → [parser.lux] → [checker.lux] → [codegen.lux] → bytecode → execute
```
All four components working. **The compiler compiles its own source** (70,752 chars
total) AND executes the compiled bytecode: `println(2+3) → 5` through the
entirely self-hosted pipeline. Includes match expressions with field binding,
lambda/closures with upvalue capture, type declarations, Why Engine.
See `std/compiler/`.

Standard library: `std/prelude.lux`, `std/test.lux`, `std/types.lux`, `std/dsp/`, `std/ml/`

## Effect System — Syntax Reference

```lux
effect Fail { fail(msg: String) -> Never }
effect State { get() -> Int, set(val: Int) -> () }

// Declare what you need
fn increment() -> () with State { set(get() + 1) }

// Caller decides how to provide it
handle { increment(); increment(); get() } with state = 0 {
  get() => resume(state),
  set(v) => resume(()) with state = v,
}
// => 2

// Let destructuring (tuple, nested, wildcard)
let (a, b) = (1, 2)
let (out, recorded_tape) = handle { forward(model, x) } with tape = [] { ... }
let (_, second) = some_tuple

// Handler composition — named, reusable handlers
handler compute_forward {
  forward_mat_vec_mul(w, xv) => resume(mat_vec_mul(w, xv)),
  forward_vec_add(a, b) => resume(vec_add(a, b)),
}

// Bare handler reference (inference = one-liner)
handle { forward(model, x) } with compute_forward

// Handler inheritance
handler logging_compute: compute_forward {
  forward_mat_vec_mul(w, xv) => { println("mul"); resume(mat_vec_mul(w, xv)) },
}

// Override clauses inline
handle { body } with compute_forward { forward_relu(xs) => resume(relu_vec(xs)) }

// Effect negation — compile-time capability proofs
fn process(x: Int) -> Int with !Alloc { x * 2 }    // provably no allocation
fn sandbox(x: Int) -> Int with Log, !Network { ... } // can log, provably no network
fn pure_add(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int with Pure { a + b } // provably no effects at all

// Effect subtraction — capability removal (same as negation, reads as transformation)
fn safe_v1(x: Float) -> Float with DSP, !Network, !Alloc { ... } // traditional negation
fn safe_v2(x: Float) -> Float with DSP - Network - Alloc { ... }  // subtraction syntax
// Both are equivalent — same constraints, different emphasis
```

## VM Internals

> These are implementation details of the bytecode VM.
> They will be replaced when self-hosting or Cranelift codegen lands.

- Stack-based execution with `VmValue` enum (Int, Float, Bool, String, List, Closure, etc.)
- `FnProto` for compiled function prototypes, `Closure` for captured upvalues
- `HandlerFrame` stack for effect dispatch
- Evidence-passing for direct handler dispatch (bypass handler stack search)
- Tail-resumptive fast-path: skips continuation capture for `resume(pure_expr)` handlers
- `BundledClosure` for passing effect-requiring functions as values

| Phase | What |
|-------|------|
| 1 | Self-hosted codegen (**DONE**) |
| 2 | Why Engine — reasoning chains on every inference |
| 3 | Effect tracking — Pure proofs, effect rows |
| 4 | Effect algebra — !E, E-F, E&F, compilation gates |
| 5 | Ownership — own/ref/gc, borrow inference |
| 6 | Refinement types — Z3-backed compile-time predicates |
| 7 | Native backend — Cranelift (dev) + LLVM (release) |
| 8 | Gradient system — continuous annotation→guarantee curve |
| 9 | Type-directed synthesis — write the type, get the code |
| 10 | Full self-hosting — delete every .rs file |
